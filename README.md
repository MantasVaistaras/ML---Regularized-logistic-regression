# ML---Regularized-logistic-regression

We will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Suppose we are the product manager of the factory and we have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, we would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, we have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which we can build a logistic regression model.

We are using complex calculations to optimize the cost function in order to find the boundary. Here is the result:
